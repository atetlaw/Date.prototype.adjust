Usage:

var d = new Date();
d.adjust(years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds); 
All the arguments are required, use 0 for no adjustments
Use negative numbers to go back in time
Year roll over is handled, for example if you add 15 months.
For example, this code will adjust a date 3 months and 5 days into the future:

var d = new Date();
d.adjust(0, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0);
